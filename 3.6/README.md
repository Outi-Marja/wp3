## Recommendations
1. Selection of appropriate dimensions or attributes to characterize usability requirements.
Different  users  can  have  different  expectations  and  preferences  with  regard  to  security  or  privacy mechanisms to be deployed in a system. Therefore, it is essential to select appropriate dimensions or attributes  (e.g., knowability,  operability(effectiveness), efficiency,  robustness,  safety, satisfaction)  to characterize usability requirements specific to each security and privacy mechanism
2. Selection  of  suitable  usability  inspection  methods  during the  design  and  development  phase  of security or privacy mechanisms pertaining to a system.
D3.5 recommended an early user involvement should be ensured for new security and privacy features Table 1presents  popular  usability  inspection  evaluation  methods,they should be  applied  for  the usability evaluation of security or privacy designs. The outcome of this step is to generate a usability requirements validation checklist that should be used as an input for usability testing with users.
3. Selection of more than one “usability testing with users”approaches.
D.5 recommended user modellingand/or user tests should be conducted for new security and privacy features. More than one usability testing with users approaches presented in Table 2should be selected tovalidate the usability requirements checklist generated as a result of Step 2.
4. Creation of a usability traceability matrix.
D3.5 recommended that usability research methods should be used throughout the design, development, and  assessment  of  security  mechanisms.  Thus,  a  traceability  matrix should be  prepared  that can  link between 1) the privacy or security specifications, 2) usability requirements for each privacy and security specification,  3)  usability  validation  checklist,  and  4)  the  test  cases,  surveys,  and  questionnaires  to synergize the usability validation framework.
5. Validation of usability requirements for authenticated encryption.
D3.5 recommended the use of authenticated encryption to protect the integrity of the communications as well as the privacy of the content. It is recommended to capture usability requirements for designing such  solutions  by  involving  a  wider  audience.  Subsequently,  their  nature  and  habits  to  be  studied  to prepare a usability validation checklist.
5. Validation of usability requirements for user authentication.
D3.5 recommended providing user authentication methods  that are  both secure  and privacy-friendly, suggesting  the  use  of  biometrics.  Generally,  a  user  generally  uses  a  number  of  smart  devices  and security-sensitive  applications  on  a  daily  basis.  Usability  validation  methods  must  ensure  that  user authentication schemes do not add cognitive load, easeof use, do not require any technical knowledge, and do not frustrate users.
