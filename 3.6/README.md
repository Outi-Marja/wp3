## Usability Evaluation
Usability evaluation can be performed during the design and development phase of a system, i.e., formative evaluation,   or   based   on   users'   studies   during   and   after   the   use of the   system,   i.e.,   summative evaluation.  According  to  Fernandez  et  al.,  usability  evaluation  methods  (UEMs)  can  be classified  into  two  different  types,  i.e.,  inspection  methods  and  empirical  methods.  Typically,  usability evaluation  methods  incorporate  techniques,  such  as  inspection,  testing,  or  survey,  for  the  assessmentofusability objectives accomplishment for a system.
### Usability inspection methods
In  the  usability  inspection  method,  experienced  practitioners  like  usability  specialists  and  security professionals examine the usability aspects of a system, i.e., there is no participation of real end-users. The goal  is  to  gather  some  useful  insights  by evaluating  the  designs  or  testing  the  systems  related  to  various components  that  involve  human-computer  interaction  (HCI).  This  can  range  from  checking  the  level  of achievement of specific usability attributes to heuristic evaluations for predictions of usability problems. 
The popular usability inspection methods are Pluralistic Walkthrough , Heuristic Evaluation, Cognitive Walkthrough, Heuristic Walkthrough, Task–Centred Walkthrough, Metaphors of Human  Thinking  (MOT), and Persona  Based  Inspection.
### Usability Testing with users
Usability testing approaches involve representative users to work on typical tasks using the system. The task execution result of each user is analysed to assess the system's friendliness. Testing methods for usability evaluation include Think Aloud Testing, Wizard of Oz, Coaching Method, Co-discovery Learning, Question asking  protocol,  Benchmark  Testing,  and  Retrospective  testing.
### Questionnaire and survey methods
Questionnaire and survey methods can be categorised as empirical methods, which rely on capturing and analysing usage  data from the real end-users. The software  product (or a prototype) is distributed to real end-users  to  perform  a  predefined  set  of  activities  and  the  outcomes  are  recorded  for  detailed  usability evaluation, later.
Empirical methods analyse the usability of a system by assessing 1) users' satisfaction to accomplish their objectives  with  the  system  and,  2)  the  mental  model perceived  by  users  after  using  the  system  for  some time.  In  this  category,  Rating  Scales,  Satisfaction  Questionnaire,  and  System  Usability  Scale  (SUS)  are some commonly used methodologies. 
## Usability dimensions and attributes
Eventually, to  determine  usability  requirements  in  security  and  privacy, end-users’expectations  and preferences on these aspects are required to be captured and translated into technical specifications.  Usability and User Experience (UUX) evaluation divides in  attributes, i.e., knowability, operability, efficiency, robustness, safety, and subjectivesatisfaction.
## Formal usability metrics to quantify usability and optimization criteria
An elegant way to validate usability is opened if easy to measure usability metrics are available. Having a complete  set  of  such  metrics  would  allow us  to  compare  or  optimize  usability  aspects  automatically  and reliable by aggregating metric scores or using them as optimization criteria.
While usability is influenced  by the  experience, preference,  and ability of each individual user, there  are some  aspects  of  usability  that  are  still  universal.  One  usability  goal,  for  example,  is  often  to  reduce complexity. One common way to find usability goals is to ask users about the difficulties or usability related tasks that they face and aggregate what the common problems are. The goals for access control rule set configuration there are the following:
* G1.Allow no more than the owner wants to be allowed. 
* G2.Allow everything the owner wants to be allowed. 
* G3.A rule must not be fully covered by another rule of the same ruleset. 
* G4.Two rules belonging to the same rule set must not conflict.
* G5.Minimize the number of ruleset elements.
* G6.Minimize maintenance effort in a changing system.

## Recommendations
1. Selection of appropriate dimensions or attributes to characterize usability requirements.
Different  users  can  have  different  expectations  and  preferences  with  regard  to  security  or  privacy mechanisms to be deployed in a system. Therefore, it is essential to select appropriate dimensions or attributes  (e.g., knowability,  operability(effectiveness), efficiency,  robustness,  safety, satisfaction)  to characterize usability requirements specific to each security and privacy mechanism
2. Selection  of  suitable  usability  inspection  methods  during the  design  and  development  phase  of security or privacy mechanisms pertaining to a system.
D3.5 recommended an early user involvement should be ensured for new security and privacy features Table 1presents  popular  usability  inspection  evaluation  methods,they should be  applied  for  the usability evaluation of security or privacy designs. The outcome of this step is to generate a usability requirements validation checklist that should be used as an input for usability testing with users.
3. Selection of more than one “usability testing with users”approaches.
D.5 recommended user modellingand/or user tests should be conducted for new security and privacy features. More than one usability testing with users approaches presented in Table 2should be selected tovalidate the usability requirements checklist generated as a result of Step 2.
4. Creation of a usability traceability matrix.
D3.5 recommended that usability research methods should be used throughout the design, development, and  assessment  of  security  mechanisms.  Thus,  a  traceability  matrix should be  prepared  that can  link between 1) the privacy or security specifications, 2) usability requirements for each privacy and security specification,  3)  usability  validation  checklist,  and  4)  the  test  cases,  surveys,  and  questionnaires  to synergize the usability validation framework.
5. Validation of usability requirements for authenticated encryption.
D3.5 recommended the use of authenticated encryption to protect the integrity of the communications as well as the privacy of the content. It is recommended to capture usability requirements for designing such  solutions  by  involving  a  wider  audience.  Subsequently,  their  nature  and  habits  to  be  studied  to prepare a usability validation checklist.
5. Validation of usability requirements for user authentication.
D3.5 recommended providing user authentication methods  that are  both secure  and privacy-friendly, suggesting  the  use  of  biometrics.  Generally,  a  user  generally  uses  a  number  of  smart  devices  and security-sensitive  applications  on  a  daily  basis.  Usability  validation  methods  must  ensure  that  user authentication schemes do not add cognitive load, easeof use, do not require any technical knowledge, and do not frustrate users.
