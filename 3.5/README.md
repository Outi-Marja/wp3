# Abstract
This page describes the main outputs of CS4E-WP3-T5.
to demonstrate the outputs of this task we use the MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute) loop architecture [19] which is the reference architecture for engineering adaptive systems [20]. It monitors (M) the protected sub-system and its operating environment and maintains an updated representation of the protected sub-system and its operating environment at runtime (Knowledge - K). The Knowledge also represents information about threats and security requirements. The protecting sub-system uses this representation to analyze (A) security threats and assess security risks, and plan (P) and execute (E) countermeasures aimed to prevent or thwart the threats discovered during analysis.
We showcase how the assets provided by each partner of task T3.5 can be used to implement a specific activity of an adaptive security system in order to support some of the maritime transport use case scenarios elicited in task T5.5 [ref]. For reasons of simplicity, here we focus on a specific subset of the use cases that are relevant for engineering adaptive security systems.  



# Overview
The main contributions that our assets bring to the architecture of an adaptive security system can be summarized as follows:

*	Data-flow-centric threat assessment: an approach to automate threat elicitation and identify evolving threats when the architecture of the system changes. 
*	Adaptive Authentication: a decision-making technique to automatically select an authentication method that mitigates the security risks and maximizes the satisfaction of security and other requirements, such as performance and usability.
*	Situation-driven risk assessment and security enforcement: an approach to identify situations and pre-compute security risks based on the utilized assets, threats, vulnerabilities and impacts. Depending on the security risks this approach can enforce situation-specific security controls that effectively mitigate the risks.
*	Adaptive risk assessment:  a novel technique to verify effectiveness of security controls when changing scenarios affect interdependencies between system components.
*	Adaptive incident reporting: a novel approach to incident reporting that can adaptively change the reporting process and the report template depending on the type of incident and the location of the components affected by the security incidents.
Finally, we identify General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance issues that can arise in adaptive security systems.

### Scenario 1: Data-flow-centric threat assessment

#### Summary

The focus of the first scenario is on the modelling and analysis of threats elicited for the maritime Transport example.

Step 1a: Model the DFD: a DFD model of the maritime case was created, based upon the characterization of the Maritime Transport example, and augmented with public information about the systems and concepts referred to (e.g., Search and Rescue Transceiver (SART), Automated Identification System (AIS)). 
As most of the attacks presented in the descriptions of the Maritime Transport example (cf. Section 3.1) are aimed directly at individual vessels, the DFD is modeled from the perspective of an individual vessel, and the other systems are modeled as external entities. The outcome is presented in Figure 13.
Step 1b: Model enrichment: definition of asset values and instantiation of countermeasures in the model. This creates an overlay of (non-visible) elements that are considered during threat elicitation. In terms of countermeasures, none are selected in a first instance, and thus, a wide array of potential threat scenarios will automatically be considered.
Step 1c: selection of threat catalog: SPARTA allows for customized threat catalogs, and these can be loaded dynamically via the UI. For the Maritime Transport example, we loaded the generic threat catalog that encodes the STRIDE threat categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of Privilege). These threat categories focus on design-level issues/weaknesses and emphasize less on specific attack types (e.g., malware, ransomware).
Step 2: Threat elicitation: This is an automated generation step that yields several threats instantiated in the specific system. For example, at the basis of the above DFD, the following threats are generated by SPARTA:

In total, the automated threat elicitation step yields 1136 distinct threat scenarios at the basis of the above DFD. This is a consequence of a combinatorial explosion, a phenomenon called threat explosion![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21111801/171427857-4b8684ed-a967-42d6-8d42-1a1a1c8310c5.png)

Step 4: Mitigate threats: in the fourth step, mitigations, countermeasures, and controls can be instantiated to reduce the overall risk. As depicted in Figure 16, in the current model, no such mitigations have been selected yet (risk reduction progress is still zero).![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21111801/171427905-06d9e77f-f62e-4197-acd3-b731177cfcca.png)
